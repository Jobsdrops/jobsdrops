          <h2 class="h2" style="margin-top:18px">Choosing a Career Path in High School (South Africa)</h2>
<p>Choosing a career is not a single decision you make once; it is a series of small, informed choices you make over time. In South Africa, the subjects you select from Grade 9 onwards can open doors or narrow options, especially for programmes that require Mathematics or Physical Sciences. The goal of this guide is to help learners make choices that are realistic, informed, and aligned with both their interests and the requirements of further study.</p>
<p>Start with interests, not job titles. Many learners say “I want to be an accountant” or “I want to be a doctor,” but the better question is: what kind of problems do you enjoy solving? Do you like working with people, analysing information, building things, caring for others, or creating ideas? Careers are often grouped into broad themes such as Business and Commerce, Science and Engineering, Health Sciences, Education and Social Services, Law and Public Service, and Creative Industries. If you identify your theme, it becomes easier to explore several careers within it.</p>
<p>Know what your strengths mean. Being “good at Maths” is helpful, but strength is more than marks. It includes focus, consistency, and the ability to practice. If you struggle now, it does not automatically mean you cannot follow a Maths‑heavy career; it may mean you need better study habits, tutoring, or more time. On the other hand, if you perform well in languages, you might be suited to careers that rely on communication, writing, negotiation, or teaching. Use your results as feedback, not as a final verdict about your future.</p>
<p>Understand subject gates early. Some careers have strict requirements. For example, most engineering and some computing programmes require Mathematics and Physical Sciences. Many health programmes require Mathematics (not Mathematical Literacy) and strong results in Life Sciences. Accounting programmes often prefer Mathematics and may require a minimum level of achievement. If you are unsure, choose the subjects that keep options open, especially Mathematics, Physical Sciences, and Life Sciences, as long as you can commit to improving in them. When you remove these subjects, some doors close permanently.</p>
<p>Use the APS score as a planning tool. Universities use an Admission Point Score (APS) to assess applications. The APS is calculated from your results (usually your best subjects excluding Life Orientation, depending on the institution). Each university sets different APS requirements for each programme. Planning early helps you avoid disappointment. If you know a programme requires a high APS, you can set a realistic goal, start improving your marks now, and prepare a backup plan in case you do not meet the requirement.</p>
<p>Compare pathways, not just institutions. In South Africa, there are multiple routes to the same outcome. Universities are a strong option for degrees, but TVET colleges offer practical diplomas and occupational programmes that lead directly to the workplace. SETA‑linked learnerships and apprenticeships can also provide a funded route into a trade or technical career. Private colleges may offer specialised training, but costs can be higher and accreditation must be checked carefully. The best pathway depends on your circumstances, finances, learning style, and the career you want.</p>
<p>Talk to the right people and ask specific questions. It helps to speak to professionals, students, and career counsellors, but you must ask clear questions. Instead of asking “Is your job nice?”, ask: What does a typical day look like? What subjects were required? What did you study after school? What skills matter most? What do you wish you knew when you were in high school? These questions give you real insight rather than opinions.</p>
<p>Do short research projects. Choose two careers you are interested in and do a one‑page research summary for each: what the job involves, what you must study, where you can study, the duration, and the costs. Add bursary and funding options. This process trains you to make decisions based on evidence, not social media trends. It also helps you speak confidently when you apply for programmes or scholarships.</p>
<p>Build “career skills” while you are still a learner. Universities and employers value more than marks. Learn basic computer skills, write clearly, practise public speaking, and join activities that show commitment. Volunteering, leadership roles, sports, debate, science clubs, or community projects can strengthen your profile. If you want to go into business, start learning budgeting and simple business planning. If you want to go into computing, learn basic coding from free resources. These small efforts compound over time.</p>
<p>Plan for funding early. Many learners only think about money after acceptance, but the best approach is to plan before you apply. Understand the basics of NSFAS, bursaries, scholarships, and student loans. Keep a folder (digital and physical) with your documents: ID, proof of address, parent/guardian details, school results, and certificates. When opportunities open, you will be ready.</p>
<p>Keep a flexible plan. A good plan includes both ambition and flexibility. Choose a “first choice” career path, a “second choice” that uses similar subjects, and a practical backup route (for example, a diploma or a learnership) that still builds your future. Success is not one narrow road; it is progress in a direction you can sustain.</p>
<p>If you feel stuck, start with subject choices that keep your options open and focus on improving your results. You do not need to have your full life figured out in Grade 9 or Grade 10. You need a thoughtful plan, consistent effort, and the willingness to learn about opportunities as they appear.</p>

        <article class="card" id="subjects" style="margin-top:14px">
          <h2 class="h2" style="margin-top:18px">High School Subjects for Popular Careers in South Africa</h2>
<p>Your subject choices in high school are not only about passing; they are about keeping doors open for the careers and qualifications you want to pursue. In South Africa, subject requirements differ by institution and programme, but there are common patterns. This guide explains the most common subject combinations for popular career paths, how to think about Mathematics versus Mathematical Literacy, and what to do if you are not sure yet.</p>
<p>Mathematics vs Mathematical Literacy. This is the first major decision. Mathematics is required for many degree programmes in Commerce, Science, Engineering, and Health Sciences. Mathematical Literacy is accepted for some programmes, especially in fields that are more social‑science oriented, certain diplomas, and many TVET pathways. If you have a realistic chance to pass Mathematics and you can commit to consistent practice, Mathematics usually keeps more options open. However, if Mathematics is likely to prevent you from qualifying for a pass and a strong APS, Mathematical Literacy can be a smart choice for learners whose target programmes accept it. The key is to match the subject choice to your target pathway.</p>
<p>Physical Sciences and Life Sciences. These subjects act as gateways into technical and health fields. Physical Sciences is often required for Engineering, certain IT and Applied Science programmes, and some technical diplomas. Life Sciences is commonly required or recommended for Health Sciences and Biological fields (such as Nursing, Physiotherapy, Environmental Science, and Zoology). If you are considering any science‑based career, choosing at least one of these subjects is helpful, and in many cases, choosing both is best.</p>
<p>Accounting and Business Studies. Accounting is valuable for Commerce pathways and provides a strong foundation for financial thinking. It is recommended (and sometimes preferred) for Accounting, Auditing, and related programmes, although many universities will still accept learners without Accounting if they have strong Mathematics results. Business Studies supports careers in Business Management, Entrepreneurship, Marketing, Human Resources, and public administration. These subjects also help if you want to start small projects while you are still at school.</p>
<p>Languages and Communication. English is a core requirement for most programmes, and strong language skills matter across all careers. Law, Education, Journalism, Public Relations, and many business roles depend on reading, writing, and clear communication. If you are strong in languages, you can build an advantage by improving essay writing, comprehension, and public speaking. Do not treat language subjects as “easy marks”; treat them as career skills.</p>
<p>Common career pathways and recommended subjects:</p>
<ol>
<li>Chartered Accountant / Accountant (Commerce). Recommended: Mathematics, Accounting (strongly recommended), English, and any two supportive subjects such as Business Studies, Economics, or Information Technology (where available). Many universities require a solid level of Mathematics. If you plan to follow a professional route like SAICA, strong Maths and Accounting help with first‑year coursework.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>Software Developer / IT (Technology). Recommended: Mathematics (often required), Physical Sciences (recommended), English, and Information Technology (if your school offers it). Even without IT as a subject, Mathematics is important because it supports problem solving and logical thinking. Learners can also build skills outside school by learning basic coding and digital literacy.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>Engineer (Civil, Mechanical, Electrical). Recommended: Mathematics (required), Physical Sciences (required), English, and supportive subjects such as Engineering Graphics and Design (if offered) and Computer Applications Technology. Engineering programmes are competitive; strong marks matter.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>Doctor / Medicine and Health Sciences. Typical requirements: Mathematics (required), Life Sciences (required), Physical Sciences (often required), and strong English. Health programmes are highly competitive; your marks and APS must be strong, and requirements vary by university.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>Nursing. Requirements differ by institution. Many universities prefer Mathematics and Life Sciences, while some colleges accept Mathematical Literacy with strong overall performance. Life Sciences is usually helpful, and English is essential.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>Lawyer (LLB). Recommended: strong English and additional languages, History (helpful), and subjects that strengthen writing and argument. Mathematics is not usually required for law, but it may still support a strong APS. The most important preparation is reading, writing, and critical thinking.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>Teacher / Education. Requirements depend on phase and teaching subject. Strong language results are important. If you want to teach Mathematics or Sciences, you should take those subjects. For Foundation Phase, strong language skills and overall results often matter most.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>Zoologist / Environmental Scientist. Recommended: Mathematics (often required or strongly recommended), Life Sciences (essential), Physical Sciences (helpful), and Geography (very useful for environmental pathways). This pathway often continues to postgraduate study, so developing strong study habits early is important.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>Marketing / Communications. Recommended: English, Business Studies, and subjects that improve creativity and analysis. Mathematics may be accepted or required depending on the institution and programme, but many marketing programmes accept Mathematical Literacy. Check the specific institution’s requirements.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>Trades (Electrician, Plumber, Welder, Mechanic). Many trades are accessible through TVET colleges, apprenticeships, and learnerships. Mathematics and Physical Sciences are helpful, but requirements can be more flexible than degree programmes. Practical ability, discipline, and consistent learning matter a lot.</li>
</ol>
<p>What if you are unsure? Choose a “broad access” combination that keeps the most doors open: Mathematics, Physical Sciences, and/or Life Sciences where possible, plus English. If this combination is too heavy, choose Mathematics with one science, or Mathematical Literacy with a clear target pathway that accepts it. The earlier you check requirements, the easier it is to choose correctly.</p>
<p>Finally, remember: subject choices matter, but they are not the only factor. Your effort, study habits, and willingness to learn can change your results significantly over time. Use this guide as a starting point, then confirm requirements on the official pages of universities, TVET colleges, or professional bodies before you finalise your applications.</p>
